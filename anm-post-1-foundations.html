                <p class="introduction">
                    Welcome, future ANM candidates! This is the first part of our comprehensive study notes on "Community Health Nursing." In this post, we'll cover the fundamental concepts of health and community practices essential for your upcoming CGVyapam exam.
                </p>

                <h2>1. Concept of Health</h2>
                <p>
                    Health is not merely the absence of disease, but a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being.
                </p>
                <h3>Dimensions of Health:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>**Physical:** The body's functional ability.</li>
                    <li>**Mental:** The ability to think clearly and make rational decisions.</li>
                    <li>**Social:** The ability to form relationships and interact with others.</li>
                    <li>**Spiritual:** A sense of purpose in life.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The modern concept is dynamic, and holistic, encompassing these multiple dimensions.
                </p>

                <h2>2. Community Health Practices</h2>
                <p>
                    These are efforts aimed at promoting health and preventing disease in a specific community. The focus is on the community as a whole, not just the individual.
                </p>
                <h3>Key Activities:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>**Health Promotion:** Educating people on healthy lifestyles (e.g., proper nutrition, hygiene).</li>
                    <li>**Disease Prevention:** Implementing programs like vaccinations and screening tests.</li>
                    <li>**Sanitation and Environmental Health:** Ensuring clean water supply and proper waste disposal.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. Health Problems and Policies</h2>
                <p>
                    Community health workers must identify and address common health problems in their area.
                </p>
                <h3>Common Health Problems in India:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Communicable diseases (e.g., Tuberculosis, Malaria)</li>
                    <li>Nutritional deficiencies (e.g., Anemia)</li>
                    <li>Maternal and child health issues</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    **Health Policies** are the guidelines and plans set by the government to tackle these problems. A few major policies in India include the National Health Mission (NHM) and the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM), which focus on accessible and affordable healthcare.
                </p>
